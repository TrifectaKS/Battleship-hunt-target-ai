An excellent research idea with potential for a dissertation.

Reorganise the git repository

Revise your objectives and subjectives (final submission and dissertation proposal) as follows:
1 - Research:
1.1 theme 
1.2 tools
1.3 academic aspect 

2 - Develop:
2.1 dataset 
2.2 prototype 

3 - Analysis:
3.1 data (is it a large enough dataset, is it biased, is it limited to text only,...)
3.2 prototype (its accuracy, limitations)
3.3 hypothesis (is it a feasible idea, did it work, ...)
3.4 research
3.5 project (were you given enough time, guidance, meetings were enough..)

4 - documentation
4.1 initial proposal
4.2 ieee paper
4.3 viva presentation

As current alternatives do an official citation of other research, via google scholar, such as:
	http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ited.1100.0047
	https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roman_Yampolskiy/publication/256169421_Using_a_GA_and_Wisdom_of_Artificial_Crowds_to_solve_solitaire_battleship_puzzles/links/56df4f4f08ae979addef591b.pdf
	
Revise your schedule (final submission and dissertation proposal) to cover the various tasks in the entire project.
